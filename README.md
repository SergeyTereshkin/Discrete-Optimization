#Discrete optimization
1. Knapsack
Dynamic programming (on small instances) + greedy algorithm (on big instances) –– sorting by density
2. Graph colouring
Constraint programming: first-fail principle
3. TSP
Local search: 2-opt + 3-opt + simulated annealing
4. Facility Location
Linear programming: solution with Gurobi solver
5. Vehicle Routing
Local search: Clarke-Wright savings heuristic + 3-opt
